# Peer-learning group "AI for Medicine and Life Sciences Journal Club"
This peer-learning group consists of a journal club in which we discuss scientific articles related to the use of artificial intelligence in medicine or life sciences. The group meets several times per year (currently online) and you can sign up or leave anytime. There is no mandatory attendance and no credits will be given for taking part in this peer-learning group.

In every meeting a single article is presented (group members take turns). Papers will be mailed out the week before the presentation and are pre-approved by the group organizers to ensure they meet the following journal club criteria:

- It can be understood by people who work with machine learning in medicine/life science, even if they are not experts in the specific area of the paper
- The study presents and AI tool which has an application within medicine/life science (it is not necessary that the paper concerns a medical problem but it should clearly be possible to apply the tools presented in the article to a medical problem)?
- The overall quality of the paper is high (even though there may be some flaws)?
- Models are evaluated appropriately, e.g. by comparing with other tools that were designed for the same task
- The study is conceptually interesting/novel
- Open source code is provided

## Joining the peer-learning group
It is possible to join the peer-learning group anytime. Please register by emailing your full name and affiliation to the group organizers Rafsan Ahmed (rafsan.ahmed [at] med.lu.se) and Salma Kazemi Rashed (salma.kazemi_rashed [at] med.lu.se). After that, these are the next steps:

#### For Lund University PhD students, Postdocs or employees:
To participate in the peer-learning group, you need to register as a COMPUTE member. To do this, simply submit the sign-up form according to the instructions on the COMPUTE website: http://www.compute.lu.se/

#### For LU Undergraduate students and people not affiliated with Lund University:
You will be signed up automatically as a COMPUTE associate.

After your registration, we will add you to the "COMPUTE members" team on Microsoft Teams. After connecting, please click on the channel "AI4MedLife journal club" and introduce yourself. Use the Teams channel to discuss with your peers in between meetings. You can also share links, e.g. to interesting papers you find outside of the journal club, your notebooks with coding projects or additional training material. 

Instructions for how to use Microsoft Teams can be found here: https://www.staff.lu.se/organisation-and-governance/coronaviruscovid-19-information-regarding-staffphd-doctoral-students/working-home-tools-and-tips/quick-guide-microsoft-teams

The group organizers will get in touch with further instructions and the meeting schedule. You are also expected to sign up for an article presentation yourself.

### COMPUTE Research School
COMPUTE is a research school with a focus on scientific discovery using computing, but in the widest sense, meaning any research using digital tools or e-Science for short. COMPUTE brings together partners from several different departments at Lund University. It organizes PhD courses, seminars, workshops and other activities.
